### Favourites

- Start with:
	- scatter plot of artists, x = unique tracks, y = listening time

- Transition:
	- Zoom into point on scatter plot dot becomes:
		- Pie chart with proportion of each album listening time
	- Slide to the side reveals:
		- Histogram with top tracks

### Time

- x = time of day, y = listening frequency
	- Stacked chart differentiated by genre
- Transition: 
	- rotate -90, average day splits & glide into 7 days
- x = Day of week, y = time of day, either:
	- colour = frequency of listening in 15 min bins
	- each day has violin chart, width = frequency of listening in 15 min bins, colour = genre
