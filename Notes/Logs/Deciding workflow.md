## Initial thoughts on workflow

### Project Environment
```
Language : Python
Packages : {
	Graphing : Manim
} 
```

Python is what I'm most comfortable with at the moment, especially for working with datasets.
I have never used Manim, but I would like to give it a try. It appears to be great for producing polished and beautiful animations for data and graphs.

### Public vs Private
I want to be able to publish this publicly on github, however I don't want to put things like my ip & location out so I will have to wait until I have:
- finished [[Project Proposal#Aims|Aim 1 - Produce a function that goes from Spotify extended history zip file to usable dataset]],
- save the dataset, 
- written a temporary function that imports the filtered dataset,
- Deleted / git.ignore [[my_spotify_data.zip]].

Once I have this can be a completely transparent process.
