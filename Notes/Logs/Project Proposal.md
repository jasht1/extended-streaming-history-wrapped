## Project Proposal

Creating a script that generates my own version of wrapped with visualisations I find interesting.

### Aims

1. Produce a single script that goes from Spotify extended history zip file to usable dataset
2. Produce some interesting graphs with the dateset
3. Produce an animation featuring the graphs
4. Produce portrait and square versions of the animation
5. Produce a redistributable runtime for people to download and run on their own Spotify exports
